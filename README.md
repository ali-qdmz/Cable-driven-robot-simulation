# Cable-driven-robot-simulation
Dynamic simulation of cable-driven robot with calculation of inverse kinematics and code generation for Adams function builder in python

Hi,

This project includes simulation of a simple cable-drievn robot. The inverse kinematics of the motion creator is calculated in a python script and the motion code for the function builder in ADAMS is generated with the same python script. Feel free to reach out if you have further questions.

Best,
Ali
